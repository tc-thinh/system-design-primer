## Problem: Puppy rental service
There are a growing number of people experiencing feelings of loneliness or depression in major cities. A non-profit is attempting to solve this problem by providing a **puppy rental service**. 

The non-profit has built out a system for allowing users to sign up for the service, as well as infrastructure to humanely house and transport puppies. However, **the non-profit has been having a lot of issues with making sure that the right people are getting puppies**. The non-profit has reached out to Palantir to help them solve the allocation problem. The existing system has APIs for retrieving user/puppy information, and now you have to design and implement a system for satisfying user requests for puppies. 

Questions to get you started...

- Who are your intended users?
- What are the real-world aspects of the problem?
- What would you choose to prioritize first?
- Are there any tradeoffs to consider?

## 
- Understanding the different constraint?
- Trade-off? This is very important
- Do not jump straight to the very first solution!!!

### A good solution
- Idea generation
- Think about the user
- Use abstraction
- Evaluate trade offs
- Establish structure
- Progress, not perfection - start from the MVP

### 
- Name, age, and location
- Separate by location, maybe zipcode
- A survey where people can enter their info, and match the puppies with that info
- Database object, user preferences
    - SQL, NoSQL
    - Blob storage
- How long would they want it
- API design?
- Scaling?
- Some algorithm to determine to evaluate the need of that person
- Some scenarios that can happen

- Check in mid interview with your recruiter
    - Do you think this is the right approach?
    - Do you want me to continue going down this path? Or do you want me to focus on the other functionality too, like ...?
