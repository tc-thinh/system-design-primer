1. What is a Load Balancer?
- A load balancer is a device or software application that distributes network or application traffic accross multiple servers.
- Benefits: distribute traffic, scale applications, improve performance, improve availability

2. Types of Load Balancers
- Hardware Load Balancers: Physical devices designed to distribute traffic across servers.
- Software Load Balancers: Applications that can be installed on standard hardware or virtual machines.
- Cloud-based Load Balancers: Provided by cloud service providers, these load balancers are integrated into the cloud infrastructure. Examples include AWS Elastic Load Balancer, Google Cloud Load Balancing, and Azure Load Balancer.

3. Load Balancing algorithms
- Round Robin
- Sticky Round Robin
- Weighted Round Robin
- IP/URL Hash
- Least Connections
- Least Time

4. Key metrics
- Traffic metrics: Request Rate, Total Connections
- Performance metrics: Response Time, Latency, Throughput
- Health metrics: Server Health Checks, Failed Health Checks
- Error metrics: HTTP Error Rates, Dropped Connections
- Load metrics: CPU Utilization, Memory Utilization, Load Distribution
- Security metrics: TLS Handshake Time, TLS Error Rates
- Availability metrics: Uptime, Failover events
